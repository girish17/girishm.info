<div style='font-family:arial; font-size:13px;'><div>Hello Girish,</div><div><br></div><div>I've started reading this book and tried hard to get through the beginning pages viz. preface, note from translator and so on. I started reading the first chapter and dozed off after a page of reading. Some things I gather from reading this book are: Metaphysics, Vedas, Buddhism, Vedanta and Philosophy.</div><div>The motivation behind reading this book is to understand the concept of 'Will'. I liked the quote from the author on solitude which is on my website (https://girishm.nfshost.com/writing.html) : "A man can be himself only so long as he is alone; and if he does not 
love solitude, he will not love freedom; for it is only when he is alone
 that he is really free"</div><div>Another quote from Schopenhauer which makes think:</div><div>"Man can do what he wills but cannot will what he wills"</div><div><br></div><div>Happy reading,</div><div>g<br></div></div><br><br>----<br>From: girishm@mailfence.com<br>To: girishm@posteo.net<br>Oct 29, 2021, 11:33:07 AM
