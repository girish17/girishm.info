<div style='font-family:arial; font-size:13px;'>Hi Girish,<div><br></div><div>I'm still watching the movie Soylent Green. I dozed off midway. The one thing that I liked about that movie is how one of the characters tries to recharge batteries at home by cycling. I mean riding a bicycle. The bicycle is connected with the dynamo or similar device that produces electric current sufficient enough to recharge the batteries. Interesting to note how the bulb diminishes when the voltage is low and how when someone starts cycling the bulb glow stabilises.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Enjoy the movie!<br><br><div> Jan 22, 2022 1:42 PM Girish M &lt;y&gt;: <blockquote><div>
    <p>Hey G,</p>
    <p>Interesting to find a movie reference: Soylent Green,&nbsp; in this
      book. Speaks of a dystopian future where the population is
      suffering due to lack of resources and a select few enjoy the
      privileges. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Important thing to note about few mathematical concepts used in
      this book viz. arithmetic and geometric progression. According to
      Malthus, the growth of human population follows a geometric
      progression whereas, the growth of resources follows arithmetic
      progression. Therefore, the population would invariably face lack
      of resources leading to hunger, poverty and other miseries.</p>
    <p>Happy Reading,</p>

        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div>I have started to read this classic book on population
          theory. The idea behind reading this book is to understand how
          human population functions and their impact on natural
          resources. The pessimistic views of Malthus over growing
          population is of my primary interest.&nbsp;</div>
