  <title>How do you build a computer like mine?</title>
</head>

<body>
  <h2>Motivation</h2>
  <p>To build a free (as in freedom, not free <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biryani">Biryani</a>) computer
    running completely on freedom respecting software without any prorpietary binary blobs.</p>
  <h2>Hardware</h2>
  <p>
    A Libreboot X200s bought from <a
      href="https://www.flashedtech.com/product-page/libreboot-x200s-notebook-8gb-ram-256ssd">here</a>.
    The proprietor of Flashed Tech, Jordan Smith was generous enough to upgrade me to 512 GB SSD for a delay in order
    processing.
    I have been using it for about a year now and it works just fine.
    There are other <a href="https://ryf.fsf.org/categories/laptops">models and vendors</a> too, whom you may buy from.
  <h3>Peripherals</h3>
  I use two external displays (<a
    href="https://images10.newegg.com/UploadFilesForNewegg/itemintelligence/dell/dell_u2412m_User_s_20Guide_en_us1400443493597.pdf">Dell
    U2412M</a>) with the above machine which are connect to an <a
    href="https://store.vikings.net/libre-friendly-hardware/ultrabase">Ultrabase X200 docking station</a>. Having a
  docking station helps in connecting
  more number of USB devices, provides for additional battery charging capability, has own speakers, and a SATA drive
  bay that could be used for DVD/CD or an additional hard disk.
  The in-built LCD display for the Libreboot has been removed completely in the setup I have (A headless unit, but with
  external displays).
  These displays are connected to Ultrabase X200 docking station using VGA and Display port cables. One display is in
  vertical and
  the other in horizontal mode.
  The vertical mode is usually used for running GUI applications and horizontal mode runs an integrated development
  environment.
  Other peripheral devices include a Dell KB216t USB keyboard, an USB mouse and a Logitech C270 HD camera with
  microphone.
  All the peripherals work with free driver softwares and do not need any proprietary binaries to be installed.

  <h2>Software</h2>
  <p>
  <h3>Firmware</h3>
  Uses <a href="https://libreboot.org/">Libreboot</a> BIOS. Proprietary BIOS and <a
    href="https://libreboot.org/faq.html#intelme">Intel management engine (ME)</a> have been me removed.
  <h3>Operating System</h3>
  <a href="https://trisquel.info/">Trisquel 8.0 - A fully free GNU/Linux operating system.</a>
  <h3>Networking</h3>
  Usage of Wired Ethernet to connect to internet using Tor as described in this <a
    href="http://www.upubuntu.com/2012/10/how-to-configure-your-computer-to-use.html?m=1">article</a>.
  The commands in the article work well with Trisquel 8. Any application can be made to run over Tor from command line.
  I use wired ethernet for networking as it supports 1Gbps bandwidth (instead of wireless).
  <h3>Desktop environment</h3>
  I use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATE_(software)">Mate</a> desktop environment for most of my work.
  I also have <a href="https://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> which can be selected before logging in.
  </p>
  <h3>Web Browser</h3>
  <a href="https://trisquel.info/en/wiki/abrowser-help">Abrowser</a> 78.0.2 with <a
    href="https://www.gnu.org/software/librejs/">GNU LibreJS</a>,
  <a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere">HTTPS Everywhere</a>, <a
    href="https://mybrowseraddon.com/tor-button.html">Onion browser button</a> and Third-party request blocker addons.
  <h3>Email</h3>
  <a href="https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Icedove">Icedove</a> email client with <a href="https://www.enigmail.net/index.php/en/">Enigmail</a> addon.
